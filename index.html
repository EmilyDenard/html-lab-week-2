        <h2>Trumps DEA nominee withdraws from consideration</h2>
        <p>
          In a statement, Chronister said Tuesday being nominated “the honor of
          a lifetime” but was stepping down after the “gravity of this very
          important responsibility set in.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important
          responsibility set in, I’ve concluded that I must respectfully
          withdraw from consideration. There is more work to be done for the
          citizens of Hillsborough County and a lot of initiatives I am
          committed to fulfilling,” he wrote in a statement. “I sincerely
          appreciate the nomination, outpouring of support by the American
          people, and look forward to continuing my service as Sheriff of
          Hillsborough County.”

          Musk and Ramaswamy want to end daylight saving time change — can they?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who will head the proposed Department
          of Government Efficiency, signaled a desire to end the semiannual
          daylight saving time clock change. There is just one problem: That
          power belongs to Congress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many political figures and influencers commented on the post in
          support of making daylight saving time permanent, including Donald
          Trump Jr. However, in 1966, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act,
          which established daylight saving time, and put the Department of
          Transportation in charge of enforcing it.

          How Kash Patel was suspected of nearly botching SEAL Team 6 rescue
          mission
        </h2>
        <p>
          Patel served in several positions during Trump’s first term in office,
          quickly rising through the ranks of the Department of Defense and the
          National Security Council. However, the narrative that follows him
          most closely is his loyalty to Trump.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident in question occurred in late October 2020 when an
          American named Philipe Nathan Walton was kidnapped from his farm in
          southern Niger and brought to Nigeria. The armed kidnappers demanded a
          ransom, and U.S. officials were concerned that they could kill Walton
          or hand him over to an Islamic terrorist group.
