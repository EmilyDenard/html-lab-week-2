        <h2>Australian tennis icon Neale Fraser dies at 91</h2>
        <p>
          Neale Fraser, the icon of Australian tennis who was the last man to
          win singles, doubles and mixed doubles titles at a single grand slam,
          has died aged 91, Tennis Australia announced on Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1959, Fraser won the triple crown – singles, doubles and mixed
          doubles titles – at the US National Championships, a run which helped
          make him men’s singles world No. 1.

          TGL: Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy’s high-tech indoor golf league to
          tee off in January
        </h2>
        <p>
          Originally slated to begin in January 2023, the televised venture was
          delayed by two years after the inflatable dome of its custom-built
          Florida venue – the SoFi Center – collapsed due to a power failure
          last November.
        </p>
        <p>
          TGL, the high-tech indoor golf league spearheaded by Tiger Woods and
          Rory McIlroy, is set to tee off at last on January 7, 2025, after a
          schedule was released Monday.

          How Max Verstappen can become a four-time F1 world champion at the Las
          Vegas Grand Prix
        </h2>
        <p>
          McLaren’s Lando Norris emerged as Verstappen’s closest challenger and
          has hunted the Dutchman for much of the season, though the British
          driver’s title dreams are close to fading entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Norris entered the weekend 62 points behind Verstappen, meaning that
          all Verstappen needs to do is finish in front of Norris in Sin City
          and the title will be his for the fourth consecutive season.
